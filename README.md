## Contributing

***We are always pleased to receive your suggestions, criticism and corrections. We want this service to be a defacto boilerplate for live streaming projects in the future. Your contributions mean a lot.***

We welcome contributions to the project. To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your_feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your_feature`)
6. Create a new Pull Request

Please ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and include tests if applicable.

*Please follow these guidelines:*

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/medhedibenali/neon_backend/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/medhedibenali/neon_backend/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open an issue on GitHub after discussing the new feature/change on the message channels(mainly discord) and receiving positive feedback.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
